# Boora and The Spire
Developed over the period of two weeks for a Pirate Software game jam.
Uses Godot 4.2 and intended to be played in browser. 

## Introduction
The theme of the jam was *Shadows & Alchemy*.

My interpretation of the theme was to have the player play as a shade creature for the shadow part of the theme and for the main mechanic having the user bring items to alchemy circles to solve puzzles. 

## Concept
The player quickly gets introduced to the idea that they must bring items to or enter dotted circles in order to interact with the game. Each puzzle and the boss encounter simply resolved around bringing the correct item to the collection circle. The main gameplay loop revolves around finding a new collection circle and then discovering what items are meant to go there.

After the intro and finding the key holes at the top the player must try to find the hidden doors that lead to the puzzles. This leads to keys which then unlock the final boss. 

## Art
I wanted the game to be very readable. My artistic ability is limited so I just embraced that and tried to get a game that could fit with an older adobe flash style game. Most assets were made in Photoshop with Boora being made through a shader. The detailed pieces in this game, the hands, were drawn by [Forrest Laffely](https://forrestlaffely.wixsite.com/forrestlaffely). 

## Audio
The music was from [Scott Buckley](https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/). Other sound FX were made using [BFXR](https://iznaut.itch.io/bfxr)

## What would I do differently 
My intended audience was meant for people who wanted to poke around in every corner of a game to figure it out but the aesthetic of the game I was making turned into a more comfy casual product. These conflicting goals led to some weakness in my execution. Rooms that were needed to progress are hidden behind invisible walls that will show a path when going near it. This was not an obvious design choice for the user to understand and I should have introduced the invisble wall concept more obviously for the player to know to seek them out or removed that idea overall. My real audience was tired game jammers that just finished their games and I should have had kept that in mind.
