# Boora and The Spire
Developed over the period of two weeks for a Pirate Software game jam.
Uses Godot 4.2 and intended to be played in browser. 

## Introduction
The theme of the jam was *Shadows & Alchemy*.

My interpretation of the theme was to have the player play as a shade creature for the shadow part of the theme and for the main mechanic having the user bring items to alchemy circles to solve puzzles.
